# **INTRODUCTION**

    .This project deals with the designing of a seven-segment display(SSD) I2C driver using ATmega328.
    
    .In most applications, however, using a single-digit seven-segment display (SSD), may not be sufficient to display the
      entire information, hence multiple SSD units are connected in parallel.
      
    .Therefore, when using a microcontroller to operate a seven-segment LED display, 8 pins are required 
     to control individual LEDs in the display, which can be brought down to 4 using a decoder.
     
     
# **SWOT ANALYSIS**

#  **STRENGTH**
 
   .ATmega328P is a high performance yet low power consumption 8-bit AVR microcontroller.
   
   .Thatâ€™s able to achieve the most single clock cycle execution of 131 powerful instructions
    thanks to its advanced RISC architecture.
    
   .It can commonly be found as a processor in Arduino boards such as Arduino Fio and Arduino Uno.
   
 # **weakness**

   .Processors are simpler to use, with the usage of 8bit and 16bit instead of 32/64bit which are more complex.
   
   .Readily usable without additional computing components with 32k bytes of onboard self-programmable flash program memory
    as well as 23 programmable I/O lines Code Efficient.
    
   .All 31 registers are directly connected to the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), making it
    10 times faster than conventional CISC microcontrollers
    
   .Optimized for AVR enhanced RISC instruction set
   
  # **opportunity**

  ATmega328P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR enhanced RISC architecture. The ATmega328P achieves throughputs approaching 1MIPS per MHz By executing     powerful instructions in a single clock cycle. This allows system designers to optimize power consumption versus processing speed very easily. ATMega328p is one of the famous   MCUs of Atmel because of its use in the Arduino UNO board. ATmega328P is designed with low current consumption features. The chip contains 32 kilobytes of internal flash         memory, 1KB of EEPROM, and 2KB of SRAM.

 # **THREAT**
 
  .High up-front costs
  
  .Performance standardization has not yet been streamlined.
